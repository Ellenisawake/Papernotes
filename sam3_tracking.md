# SAM3.1
## object multiplexing
- [blog](https://ai.meta.com/blog/segment-anything-model-3/)
- allows the model to track up to 16 objects in a single forward pass
- throughput at 32 frames per second on a single H100 GPU

# SAMIDARE
## Tracking-by-Segmentation for Dense Scenarios
- [github](https://github.com/ZabuZabuZabu/SAMIDARE)
- enhances SAM2MOT for crowded scenes
- density-aware mask re-generation
- selective memory updates
- state-aware association and new track initialization
- SportsMOT dataset


# OAMVOS:2nd Report for 5th PVUW MOSE Track
- [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2604.22837)
- occlusion- and reappearance-aware extension of DAM4SAM
- add a control layer that explicitly distinguishes stable tracking from uncertain tracking
  - stable mode, ambiguous mode, recovery mode to decide if going through several branches
