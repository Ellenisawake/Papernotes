- contrastive learning between a key frame and a reference frame
  - reference frame is selected from temporal neighborhood of key frame
  - what if no positive sample on the reference frame, e.g., object instance not found???
- empty memory bank on initialization
- CNN backbone (ResNet-50) extracts multi-scale feature maps
- deformable DETR module takes the feature maps with additional fixed positional encodings and N learnable object
queries as input
- a light-weighted FFN as a contrastive head to decode the contrastive embeddings from the instance features
- object queries are first transformed into output embeddings by the transformer decoder, then decoded into box coordinates, class labels, and instance masks
- $L=L_cls + \lambda1 * L_box + \lambda2 * L_mask + \lambda3 * L_emb$
- number of object queries is set to 300
- pre-trained on the MS COCO 2017 for segmentation head, random crops from COCO to pretrain constrastive learning head
- multi-crops during training at 11 scales (320-640), test at both single/multi-scales
